# Check out our site [before](Neurobi.com) and [after](http://Neurobi.github.io) we migrated to Github!

## This site was migrated from WordPress so that we could manage clean, open-source code and share our approach on Github
## We hope you'll agree this implementation has an improved user experience compared to the original WordPress implementation (and compared to auto-genetated WordPress code, this code is not a spaghetti-mess =)
## The code was structured modularly. It reflects our software engineering best-practices, and was commented appropriately with its intended use (on Github) as a learning resource.

### Special thanks to @prajwalsouza for posting his excellent Random-Triangle-Mesh-Generation repo! This was re-purposed to give our site some neat effects.
