# UPDATE: We completed the migration from GoDaddy hosting to GitHub! We'll have some "before and after" screenshots posted soon...
## This site was migrated from WordPress so that we could manage clean, open-source code and share our approach on Github
## The code was structured modularly. It reflects our software engineering best-practices, and was commented appropriately with its intended use (on Github) as a learning resource.
### Special thanks to @prajwalsouza for posting his excellent Random-Triangle-Mesh-Generation repo! This was re-purposed to give our site some neat effects.
